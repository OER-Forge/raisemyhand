# Student Guide

## Getting Started

### Joining a Session

Your instructor will share access to a session in one of three ways:

#### Option 1: Scan QR Code (Easiest for In-Person Classes)

1. Your instructor displays a QR code on the projector/screen
2. Open your phone camera
3. Point at the QR code until a notification appears
4. Tap the notification to open the session

#### Option 2: Click a Link (Online Classes)

Your instructor shares a URL that looks like:
```
https://questions.yourschool.edu/student?code=abc123xyz
```

Just click the link or paste it into your browser.

#### Option 3: Manual Code Entry

1. Go to the home page: `https://questions.yourschool.edu`
2. Find the "Students: Join a Session" section
3. Enter the session code your instructor provides
4. Click "Join"

## How to Participate

### Submitting a Question

1. Type your question in the text box at the top
2. Click **"Submit"** or press Enter
3. Your question appears in the list immediately
4. Your identity remains anonymous

**Good questions to ask:**
- Conceptual questions about the material
- Requests for clarification on topics discussed
- Questions about assignments or exams
- "Why" and "how" questions about the subject

**Keep in mind:**
- Your question will be reviewed for appropriate language
- Profanity will be censored automatically
- Inappropriate questions may be rejected by your instructor
- Instructors can see the original text of flagged questions to decide if they're appropriate

### Upvoting Questions

If you want your instructor to prioritize a question:

1. Find the question in the list
2. Click the **upvote button** (arrow or thumbs up icon)
3. Your upvote is added - the vote count increases
4. You can change your mind and click again to remove your vote

**Pro tip:** Questions with more upvotes appear at the top of the list. Upvote questions that you want answered!

### Seeing Answers

Your instructor may:
- **Mark as Answered** - Answers your question during class (✓ checkmark appears)
- **Write a Response** - Types a detailed answer that appears under the question
- **Reject** - Removes inappropriate questions (you won't see them)

**Answer Status:**
- ✅ **Answered** - Your instructor addressed this question
- 📝 **Answered with Details** - Your instructor wrote a detailed response
- ⏳ **No Status** - Your instructor hasn't addressed this yet

## Session Behavior

### What Happens During Class

- Questions appear as soon as they're submitted (if appropriate)
- Instructor may toggle voting on/off

### When the Session Ends

- You can no longer submit new questions
- You can still see all questions and answers from the session
- Your instructor may download all questions for their records

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific** - Instead of "I don't understand", ask "Can you explain why photosynthesis requires light?"

2. **Check Duplicates** - Look for similar questions already asked before submitting

3. **Be Respectful** - Remember your instructor will see all questions before approval

4. **Professional Language** - Avoid profanity and inappropriate language

5. **Ask Sooner** - Submit questions as they occur to you rather than waiting
